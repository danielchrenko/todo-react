# React + Vite

To Do List using Vite + React

Learning Objectives met so far:
- Understand how to notice potential components
- Create simpler code using props + iteration
    - specifically referring to listing of tasks
- cont.

Notes:
- callback prop
    - you cant send back info same way as u do with parent -> child
    so you need to use **A FUNCTION** as a prop and you can use **OUTPUT**
    of that function as a way to get info within that child
- cont.
- left off 25%, use state
